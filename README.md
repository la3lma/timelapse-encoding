# timelapse-encoding
Utility script for using ffmpeg to make timelapse videos of images captured by my dslr camera.

To use it, do something line this:

## Put ynour input data in a directory it can be reached

Make an empty directory and copy your jpg files there.  I typically copy
them directly from the memory card I use in my dslr:

    $mkdir -p foo/JPG
    $cp ls /Volumes/NIKON\ D3200/DCIM/100D3200/DSC_0*.JPG  foo/JPG


## Then run the encoder

    $ ~/git/timelapse-encoding/encode.sh foo

# The output will be located in foo/MPEG directory

    $ls foo/MPG/
    out_high_res.mpg	out_med_res.mpg

## What to do next

That's all there is to it.   The mpg files generated by the ffmpeg
can be uploaded directly to youtube.  You may want to convert them to
other formats and you may want to tune the ffmpeg params.  If you do, then
feel free to send me a PR with your improvements.
