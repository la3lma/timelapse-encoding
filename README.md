# timelapse-encoding
Utility script for using ffmpeg to make timelapse videos of images captured by my dslr camera.

To use it, do something line this:

## Put your input data in a target directory

Make an empty target directory and copy your jpg files there.  I typically copy
them directly from the memory card I use in my dslr. In this example it's
called "foo" but it can obviously be called anything.

    $mkdir -p foo/JPG
    $cp ls /Volumes/NIKON\ D3200/DCIM/100D3200/DSC_0*.JPG  foo/JPG


## Then run the encoder

    $ ~/git/timelapse-encoding/encode.sh foo

# The output will be located in target's MPG directory

    $ls foo/MPG/
    out_high_res.mpg	out_med_res.mpg

The medium resolution file will be 1280x720, which is acutally  pretty good.
The high resolution file will be 3840x2160 which is probably overdoing it. The
output will be at 16 frames per second.

## What to do next

That's all there is to it.   The mpg files generated by the ffmpeg
can be uploaded directly to youtube.  You may want to convert them to
other formats and you may want to tune the ffmpeg params.  If you do, then
feel free to send me a PR with your improvements.
